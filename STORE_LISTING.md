# Chrome Web Store Listing: PII Redactor for Gemini

## Short Description
Securely redact PII and sensitive data locally before sending it to Gemini.

## Long Description
Protect your privacy without sacrificing productivity. **PII Redactor for Gemini** allows you to redact personally identifiable information (PII), sensitive keywords, and custom data directly in your browser before it ever reaches Gemini's servers.

### Key Features:
- **Local Redaction:** Identify and hide names, emails, phone numbers, and more using a local, in-browser LLM.
- **Custom Rules:** Define your own redaction rules using natural language to filter specific content.
- **Seamless Experience:** Your redacted information is automatically rehydrated in Gemini's responses, so you see the full context while keeping your data private.
- **Zero Data Sharing:** No information is shared with developers. All keywords, processing, and statistics stay in your browser.
- **Time-Saving:** Spend less time worrying about sensitive data leaks and more time getting things done.

Experience Gemini with the peace of mind that *you* control what information it sees.

## Privacy Disclosure
This extension processes all data locally. It does not communicate with external servers except for the necessary interaction with Gemini (where only redacted data is sent).

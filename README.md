# PII Redactor for Gemini

## Why this project came to be
I found myself constantly going back to manually redact sensitive inputs from my prompts, and quite frankly, I'm too lazy to keep doing that by hand.

## What's cool about this, you ask?
- **LLM Enabled**: Intelligent PII detection and redaction using local LLMs.
- **In-Browser**: All processing happens locally within your browser—no data leaves your device.
- **Near-Instant Redaction**: Optimized for speed to minimize friction.
- **Response Rehydration**: Automatically restores redacted information in Gemini's responses for a seamless experience.

## Stack
- **Framework**: React, TypeScript, WXT
- **UI**: Mantine
- **AI**: WebLLM (running Llama-3-8B-Instruct in browser)
